# my-personal-portfolio
Repo for my own personal portfolio page as civil engineer, so as developer, which I'd like to keep public as a template

# To-do
- Replace all "civil engineering" for "civil engineer" when I finnally finish this college (this year, I hope, if this difficult pandemic moment doesn't take too long)
- My name shouldn't stack in three lines (the reason is the 'engineering' word; should be okay when replace everything for 'engineer')
- Look for the reason why sometimes the edge icons (curriculum and github) doesn't appear (when reload the page, everything works, maybe something in resizing events)
