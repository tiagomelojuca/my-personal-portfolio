# my-personal-portfolio
Repo for my own personal portfolio page as civil engineer, so as developer, which I'd like to keep public as a template

# To-do
- Look for the reason why sometimes the edge icons (curriculum and github) doesn't appear (when reload the page, everything works, maybe something in resizing events)
- Menu scroll seens buggy
